# CircuitPython_MLX90640_PyGamer_Plus
Enhanced version of thermal camera example with PyGamer and MLX90640


I wrote mlx90640_pygamer.py based on mlx90640_simpletest.py from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MLX90640
And the example code is advertised on this learn guide from @adafruit: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mlx90640-ir-thermal-camera/circuitpython-thermal-camera

I believe a thermal camera could be better:
* Use the button and joystic from the PyGamer to provide a user interface and a few feature
* Save the image on an SD card you could plug in the PyGamer
* Ameliorate the code
* Use existing Circuit Python library rather than the gradiant code I borrowed with credit from http://www.andrewnoske.com/wiki/Code_-_heatmaps_and_color_gradients
* Maybe make it work on PyPortal too, not limit ourself to PyGamer
